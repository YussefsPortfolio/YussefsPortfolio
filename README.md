# Yussef Arsalan

**A little bit about myself**

My name is Yussef Arsalan, Im living in the beautiful country of Germany, where I also have the honour of going to university too, 
Im striving to work in the Cybersecurity-Industry, so a lot of the projects will be going in that direction. All Coding projects are 
built from scratch and mostly by myself, from the idea, to the planning, to the coding and the design and testing. For building the projects,
I rely on the Knowledge, I get from university, various online Courses, Youtube Videos or LLM's.
